3.
4.
5. for JSTL tags we USE JSTL jar files in WEB-INF
6. we create welcomefilelist in web.xml and add entry of index.html, create index.html file 
7. add student file changed and changes in file.
  a. update list-students.jsp : add "add student" button
  b. creating new form in add-student-form.jsp. copied add-student-style.css. we see all are in one line it is because we have used table. also added link to go to servlet page. do nothing add <a href="filename name">give link name</a>
  c. updating studentcontrollerservlet : updating doget method as data from form will come using get request. in doget method read command and route code depending on command. command is variable we specified in
      in add-students-form.jsp(ctrl+f). we did not specified any command variable in list-students so if request.getParameter is null we set command to "list". we route it using switch case.
      created addStudent method in studentcontrollerservlet and studentdbutil. in studentdbutil created conn and statement and create & executed sql statement
